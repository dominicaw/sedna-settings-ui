# Sedna Settings UI Component Library

## To do:

1. ✅ Set up basic library folder structure as per [Vite docs](https://vite.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode)
2. ✅ Create toggle component
3. ❌ ~~Make a nice index.html?~~ Decided to extend toggle component to take size prop instead
4. ❌ ~~Tests? Probably overkill~~
